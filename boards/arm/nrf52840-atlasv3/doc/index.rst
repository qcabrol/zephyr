Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``nrf52840_atlasv3`` board configuration can be
built and flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details); The onboard Black Magic
Probe debugger presents itself as two USB-serial ports. On Linux,
they may come up as ``/dev/ttyACM0`` and ``/dev/ttyACM1``. The first
one of these (``/dev/ttyACM0`` here) is the debugger port.
GDB can directly connect to this port without requiring a GDB server by specifying
``target external /dev/ttyACM0``. The second port acts as a
serial port, connected to the SoC.

Flashing
========

Applications are flashed and run as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the serial port of Black Magic Probe.
For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyACM1`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nrf52840_atlasv3
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

Debug and attach configurations are available using Black Magic Probe, and
``ninja debug``, or ``ninja attach`` (or with ``make``) are available.

NOTE: You may need to press the reset button once after using ``ninja flash``
to start executing the code. (not required with ``debug`` or ``attach``)


Testing the LEDs and buttons in the nRF52840 PDK
************************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :ref:`blinky-sample`
* :ref:`button-sample`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/nrf52840_atlasv3/nrf52840_atlasv3.dts`.
